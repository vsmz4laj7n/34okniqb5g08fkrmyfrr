All extracted content is combined with the original content of the messages, so Telegram Explorer's search and notification mechanisms work seamlessly.

Here's a real message example:

```
Yeah, we got compromised by APT29, but luckily MalwareBytesâ„¢ FREE AV 
stopped the infection in their tracks! 

To be extra safe, we swung by the local Hotel and used their 
WiFi to install it.
