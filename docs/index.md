<!-- LIMITATIONS -->
## Know Limitations

Although we do not currently know the limitations of using the tool, it is important to announce the limits to which we test the platform.

Currently, **one TeX process can support at least** (per configuration file/per phone numer):

**Per Group**

- 50,000 messages
- 7,000 users per group
- 8 GB of downloaded files

**Total**

- 400 groups
- 800,000 messages
- 50,000 unique users
- 150 GB of total downloaded files

<!-- HOW WORKS -->
## How Telegram Explorer Works
Telegram Explorer works using one configuration file per target phone number to be used. 

![how_text_works.png](media/how_text_works.png)

So, you can deploy 1 or several Telegram Explorer runners in one machine, using on configuration file for each instance. You also can deploy the runner using Linux Containers or Docker containers.

!!! info "IMPORTANT"
    
    Depending on the security level and your account settings, you may be asked to enter a security code that will be sent to your Telegram, or some authentication information. </br></br>This way, the application will ask (only at the time of the first connection) for you to enter this value in the terminal (TTY).
